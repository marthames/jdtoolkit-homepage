		<h1 class="main-hed">Zine</h1>
	<p>For my final project of the semester, I opted to create a diary-like zine that serves as a look into my mind over these past
	 tumultuous months. Taking bits and pieces from my diary, as well as images from my camera roll,
	 this will continue to grow as more time passes and we continue to live through this collective experience. You can download the actual file

	Below are just a few spreads from the 16 page booklet, which features some very basic-level graphic text design to enhance my actual journal and visual diary. 
	Throughout the pages, as you may see, I'm playing with the idea that while I'm saying it's not a diary, it is - just not necessarily by how we would define a traditional written or formatted diary.
