		<p> As an aspiring visual journalist, some of my favorite scenes to capture include
		streetscapes and people authentically interacting in those scenes. 
		
<p>When creating imagery, I always aspire to:

<head>
<style>

ul.demo { 	
list-style-type: none;
	margin: 0px;
	padding: 0;
	display: inline-block;
	text-align: left; 
	font-size: 18px

	 
}

</style>
</head>
<body>


<ul class="demo">
<li>go beyond the surface</li>
<li>consider how my camera and my view impact what I see</li>
<li>represent the actual circumstances I'm capturing</li>
</ul>

	<p>Below is my first work sample, which follows the work of a NYC nurse,
	Patricia Tiu, over the course of five months as she worked tirelessly in COVID-19's 
	epicenter. 
	
	Originally, Patricia and I met in Times Square in March, just as COVID was beginning
	to take over the city. I briefly spoke with her as she was out telling people how 
	little PPE she and her coworkers had, and from there, we stayed in touch. In the end,
	through weekly video diaries she sent me, we were able to collaborate on a piece that spanned
	her experience in one of the most tumultuous times.

		<p>In addition to my video, the two images below are from an image editing assignment for this class. 
		The first image, captured in the downtown of my hometown Libertyville, IL, I fixed the lighting on 
		the previously underexposed snowy street to bring out the reflective qualities
		of the snow and the streetlights.

		<p>As for this scene around the piano at Washington Square Park in New York City,  I cropped the
		original image to really focus on the people interacting in the environment as
		opposed to incorporating the arch in the background.
