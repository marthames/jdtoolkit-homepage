		<p> As an aspiring visual journalist, some of my favorite scenes to capture include
		streetscapes and people authentically interacting in those scenes. 
		
		<p>Here, for the purpose of this portion of the assignment, I fixed the lighting on 
		the previously underexposed snowy street to bring out the reflective qualities
		of the snow and the streetlights.
		
		<p>As for the scene around the piano at Washington Square Park, I cropped the
		original image to really focus on the people interacting in the environment as
		opposed to incorporating the arch in the background
