<p> As we all know, the arguably most important event of this year will be the presidential
election. 

<p> For this assignment, inspired by the idea to advertise an "event", I opted to 
call for the essential action of registering to vote. While not exactly how I wanted this	
to turn out, my intention was to incorporate visuals of former Vice President Joe Biden
and President Trump, a font and coloring that stands out, and a handwritten quality that
draws viewers in. Despite not being nearly as clean as I would've liked, it was a
huge learning experience with Adobe Illustrator and graphic design.
